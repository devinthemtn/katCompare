echo "   • Version updated: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0"
echo "   • Debug enabled: false → true"
echo "   • Port changed: 8080 → 9000"

echo "How to use Merge Mode:"
echo "====================="
echo "1. Run: ../katcmp config-old.yaml config-new.yaml"
echo "2. Press Ctrl+D to start comparing"
echo "3. Navigate through differences with ↑/↓ or j/k"
echo "4. Press 'm' to enter MERGE MODE"
echo "5. In merge mode:"
echo "   • Yellow background = Selected changes (will be applied)"
echo "   • Strikethrough = Unselected changes (will be skipped)"
echo "   • Space/Enter = Toggle current change selection"
echo "   • 't' = Switch merge target (LEFT ↔ RIGHT)"
echo "   • 'a' = Select all changes"
echo "   • 'n' = Select no changes"
echo "   • 's' = Save merged result"
echo

echo "Merge Strategies:"
echo "================"
echo "🎯 TARGET: LEFT (start with config-old.yaml)"
echo "   • Select version update only → Incremental upgrade"
echo "   • Select all production settings → Full migration"
echo "   • Select only security changes → Security-focused update"
echo

echo "🎯 TARGET: RIGHT (start with config-new.yaml)"
echo "   • Select old password → Keep existing credentials"
echo "   • Select old debug setting → Maintain dev environment"
echo "   • Mix old and new features → Custom configuration"
echo

echo "Example Workflows:"
echo "=================="
echo "🔄 Scenario 1: Gradual Migration"
echo "   1. Target: LEFT (old config)"
echo "   2. Select: version update, new features"
echo "   3. Skip: production settings, breaking changes"
echo "   4. Result: Updated features with safe settings"
echo

echo "🔄 Scenario 2: Production Deployment"
echo "   1. Target: RIGHT (new config)"
echo "   2. Select: all production optimizations"
echo "   3. Skip: debug settings"
echo "   4. Result: Production-ready configuration"
echo

echo "🔄 Scenario 3: Cherry-Pick Features"
echo "   1. Target: LEFT (old config)"
echo "   2. Select: specific features (monitoring, cache)"
echo "   3. Skip: version changes, breaking updates"
echo "   4. Result: Selective feature adoption"
